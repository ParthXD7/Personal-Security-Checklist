## Password Managers

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com)**  | Free and open source, cross-platform password manager with sync
**[1Password](https://1password.com)** | Open source, fully-featured cross-platform password manager with sync. Free for self-hosted (or $3/ month hosted)
**[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)** | Open source, secure password manager, but without cloud-sync capabilities. KeePassXC is a community fork of [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
**[LessPass](https://lesspass.com)** | LessPass is a little different, since it generates your passwords using a hash of the website name, your username and a single master-passphrase that you reuse. It omits the need for you to ever need to store or sync your passwords. They have apps for all the common platforms and a CLI, but you can also self-host it.


## 2-Factor Authentication

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Aegis](https://getaegis.app)**  | Free, secure and open source app for managing 2-step verification tokens, on Android
**[AndOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP)** | Another open source, secure authenticator app. AndOTP is well established with a strong large user base

*Check which websites support multi-factor authentication: [twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org)*

**Note:** Don't use your password manager to also store your 2-FA tokens- use a separate application.


## File Encryption

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)** | VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehnsive encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable eddition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now depricated) TrueCrypt.
**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** | Open source client-side encryption for cloud files- Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac- but also has excellant mobile apps.

If you need to create a compressed archive, prior to encrypting your files, then [PeaZip](https://www.peazip.org/) is a great little cross-platform open source file archiver utility. It allows you to create, open, and extract RAR TAR ZIP archives.


## Encrypted Messaging

Without using a secure app for instant messaging, all your conversations, meta data and more is unprotected. Signal one of the best options- it's easy, yet also highly secure and privacy-centric.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Signal](https://signal.org/)** | Probably one of the most popular, secure private messaging apps that combines strong encryption (see [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)) with a simple UI and plenty of features. It's widely used across the world, and easy-to-use, functioning similar to WhatsApp - with instant messaging, read-receipts, support for media attachments and allows for high-quality voice and video calls. It's cross-platform, open-source and totally free. Signal is [recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152) by Edward Snowden, and is a perfect solution for most users
**[KeyBase](keybase.io/inv/6d7deedbc1)** | KeyBase allows encrypted real-time chat, group chats, and public and private file sharing. It also lets you cryptographically sign messages, and prove your ownership to other social identities (Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, etc), and send or receive Stella or BitCoin to other users. It's slightly more complex to use than Signal, but has some great cryptography features, and is good for group chats
**[Silence](https://silence.im/)** | If you're restricted to only sending SMS/MMS, then Silence makes it easy to encrypt messages between 2 devices. This is important since traditional text messaging is inherently insecure. It's easy-to-use, reliable and secure- but has fallen in popularity, now that internet-based messaging is often faster and more flexible
**[Matrix](https://matrix.org/)** | Matrix is a little different since it is a [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)) messaging service, hence provides an open network for secure, decentralized, real-time communication. [Riot](https://riot.im/) is a popular cross-platform, feature-full open source Matrix client. You can host your Matrix own server, or use existing ones- it functions in a similar way to Slack, so is good for groups, projects, and organizations
**[Jami](https://jami.net/)** | Jami is a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) service, meaning it connects message recipients to each other directly. P2P services don't require a third-party server, expose minimal data to third parties, and usually E2E encrypted by default. Other P2P alternatives include [Briar](https://briarproject.org/), [Bit Message](https://bitmessage.org/), and [Tox](https://tox.chat/) (beta)
**[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)** | Slightly harder to use, slower, but still widley used. Note that there are known issues in the PGP standard, but still considered secure for general purpose use. Using [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html), you can encrypt messages following the OpenPGP standard. OpenPGP was defined by the IETF, proposed in [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) and derived from the PGP software, (created by Phil Zimmermann, now owned by [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/products/encryption)). There have been vulnrabilities found in the OpenPGP and S/MIME, defined in [EFAIL](https://efail.de/), so it is often better to use an encrypted messaging or email app instead.

#### Other Notable Mentions
[Chat Secure](https://chatsecure.org/) and [Status](https://status.im/), are private, encrypted, open source messenger apps. They are both still in early stages, so were'nt included in the main list. Note that [Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tor-messenger)s been removed from the list, since development has halted.

#### Word of Warning: Closed Source Messaging 
Many messaging apps claim to be secure, but if they are not open source, then this cannot be verified- and they **should not be trusted**. This applies to [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [Threema](https://threema.ch), [Cypher](https://www.goldenfrog.com/cyphr), [Wickr](https://wickr.com/), [Silent Phone](https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/silent-phone/) and [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), to name a few- these apps should not be used to communicate any sensitive data.


## Encrypted Email

Email, is not secure- your messages can be easily intercepted and read. Coporations scan the content of your mail, to build up a profile of you, either to show you targeted ads or to sell onto third-parties. Through the [Prism Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)), the government also has full access to the plain text and meta data of all sent and received emails. This applies to Gmail, Outlook Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX, ZoHo, iCloud, AOL and more.

The below email providers are private, encrypted and safe

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)** | An open-source, end-to-end encrypted anonymous email service. ProtonMail has a modern easy-to-use and customizable UI, as well as fast, secure native mobile apps. ProtonMail has all the features that you'd expect from a modern email service and is based on simplicity without sacrificing security. It has a free plan or a premium option for using custom domains. ProtonMail requires no personally identifiable information for signup, they have a [.onion](https://protonirockerxow.onion) server, for access via Tor, and they accept anonymous payment: BTC and cash (as well as the normal credit card and PayPal).
**[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)** | Free and open source email service based in Germany. It has a basic intuitive UI, secure native mobile apps, anonymous signup, and a .onion site. Tutonota has a full-featured free plan or a premium subscription for businesses allowing for custom domains ($12/ month).
**[Mailfence](https://mailfence.com?src=digitald)** | Mailfence supports OpenPGP so that you can manually exchange encryption keys independently from the Mailfence servers, putting you in full control. Mailfence has a simple UI, similar to that of Outlook, and it comes with bundled with calendar, address book, and files. All mail settings are highly customizable, yet still clear and easy to use. Sign up is not anonymous, since your name, and prior email address is required. There is a fully-featured free plan, or you can pay for premium, and use a custom domain ($2.50/ month, or $7.50/ month for 5 domains), where BitCoin, LiteCoin or credit card is accepted.

See [OpenTechFund- Secure Email](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/secure-email) for more details.


#### Other Notable Mentions
[HushMail](https://www.hushmail.com/tapfiliate/?tap_a=44784-d2adc0&tap_s=724845-260ce4&program=hushmail-for-small-business), [StartMail](https://www.startmail.com), [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com), [Posteo](https://posteo.de), and [Disroot](https://disroot.org/en)

#### Alias Services
Revealing your real email address online can put you at risk. Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and still land in your primary inbox. This protects your real email address from being revealed. Aliases are generated automatically, the first time they are used. This approach lets you identify which provider leaked your email address, and block an alias with 1-click.

- **[Anonaddy](https://anonaddy.com)** - An open source anonymous email forwarding service, allowing you to create unlimited email aliases. Has a free plan.
- **[33Mail](http://33mail.com/Dg0gkEA)** - A long-standing aliasing service. As well as recieving, 33Mail also lets you reply to forwarded addresses anonymously. Free plan, as well as Premium plan ($1/ month) if you'd like to use a custom domain 
- **[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/pricing) Visionary** - If you already have ProtonMail's Visionary package, then an implementation of this feature is available. However not the most price-effective, and does not include dashboard

Alternativley you could host your own service


#### Self-Hosted Email
If you do not want to trust an email provider with your messages, you can host your own mail server. Without experience, this can be notoriously hard to correctly configure, especially when it comes to security. You may also find that cost, performance and features make it a less attractive optrion. If you do decide to go down this route, [Mail-in-a-box](https://mailinabox.email/), is an easy to deploy, open source mail server. It aims to promote decentralization, innovation, and privacy on the web, as well as have automated, auditable, and idempotent system configuration. Other ready-to-go self-hosted mail options include [Mailu](https://mailu.io/1.7/) and [Mail Cow](https://mailcow.email/), both of which are docker containers.

#### Mail Clients
Email clients are the programs used to interact with the mail server. For hosted email, then the web and mobile clients provided by your email service are usually adequate, and may be the most secure option. For self-hosted email, you will need to install and configure mail clients for web, desktop or mobile.

- **Dektop** - [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) is an open source, highly customizable, secure and private desktop email client, for Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you are using ProtonMail, then you can use the [ProtonMail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/thunderbird), to sync your emails to either Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook. In terms of security, the disadvantage, is that most desktop clients do not support 2FA, so it is important to keep your computer secured, however they are not vulnrable to the common browser attacks, that a web client would be. 
- **Web** - If you are self-hosting your mail server, you will probably want a web-based email client. [RainLoop](http://www.rainloop.net) and [RoundCube](https://roundcube.net) are both good open source options.
- **Mobile** - the most secure option is usually to use the app provided by your mail provider. If your mail server is self-hosted, then consider [FairMail](https://email.faircode.eu/) which is a fully featured, open source, privacy oriented email app for Android. There is also [pretty Easy privacy p‚â°p](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=security.pEp), which has OpenPGP built in. [K-9 Mail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9), which has been around almost as long as Android, has a solid reputation for privacy and security features.


## Browsers

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Brave Browser](https://brave.com/?ref=ali721)** | Brave Browser, currently one of the most popular private browsers- it provides speed, security, and privacy by blocking trackers with a clean, yet fully-featured UI. It also pays you in [BAT tokens](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) for using it. Brave also has Tor built-in, when you open up a private tab/ window.
**[FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)** | Significantly more private, and offers some nifty privacy features than Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. After installing, there are a couple of small tweaks you will need to make, in order to secure Firefox. You can follow one of these guides by: [Restore Privacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/), [Security Gladiators](https://securitygladiators.com/firefox-privacy-tips/) or [12Bytes](https://12bytes.org/7750)
**[Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)** | Bromite is Chromium (Chrome without Google) plus ad blocking and enhanced privacy. It provides a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features- it's lightweight and minimal
**[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)** | Tor is undoubtedly the king of private browsers. It provides an extra layer of anonymity, by encrypting each of your requests, then routing it through several nodes, making it near-impossible for you to be tracked using standard methods. It does make every-day browsing a little slower, and some sites will require you to complete a CAPTCHA, while others may not work at all on Tor

## Search Engines

Google frequently modifies and manipulates search, and is in persuit of eliminating competition and promoting their own services above others. They also track, collect, use and sell detailed user search and meta data.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)** | DuckDuckGo is a very user-friendly, fast and secure search engine. It's totally private, with no trackers, cookies or ads. It's also highly customisable, with dark-mode, many languages and features. They even have a [.onion](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion ) URL, for use with Tor.
**[Start Page](https://www.startpage.com/)** | Start Page displays Googles results, through but through their servers- meaning Google can not track you, but you still see results similar to what you would with Google. (European users, see also [ixquick](http://ixquick.eu/))
**[Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/)** | French service that aggregates Bings results, with it's own results. Quant doesn't plant any cookies, nor have any trackers or third-party advertising. It returns non-biased search results, with no promotions. Quant has a uinique, but nice UI

Another option would be to host your own- [Searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/) is a good option for self-hosting, since it is easy to set-up, secure, private and is backed by a strong community

## Online Tools

A selection of free online tools and utilities, to check, test and protect

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[';--have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com)** | Check if your credentials (Email address or Password) have been compromised in a data breach
**[Œµxodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org)** | Check how many, and which trackers any Android app has. Useful to understand how data is being collected before you install a certain APK, it also shows which permssions the app asks for
**[Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/)** | Check if your browser safe against tracking. Analyzes how well your browser and add-ons protect you against online tracking techniques, and if your system is uniquely configured‚Äîand thus identifiable
**[Browser Leak Test](https://browserleaks.com)** | Shows which of personal identity data is being leaked through your browser, so you can better protect yourself against fingerprinting

#### Word of Warning
*Browsers are inherintly insecure, be careful when uploading, or entering personal details*


## Virtual Private Networks

VPNs are good for getting round censorship, increasing protection on public WiFi, obscuring your IP address, and reducing what data your ISP can log. But for the most anonymity, you should use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). VPNs do not mean you are automatically protected, or anonymous (see below). 

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Mullvad](http://mullvad.net/en/)** | Mullvad is one of the best for privacy, they own all their own servers and have a totally anonymous sign up process, you don't need to provide any details at all, you can choose to pay annonymously too (with Monero, BTC or cash)
**[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** | From the creators of ProtonMail, ProtonVPN has a solid reputation. They have a full suit of user-friendly native mobile and desktop apps. ProtonVPN is one of the few "trustworthy" providers that also offer a free plan


#### Other VPN Options

[AirVPN](https://airvpn.org) has advanced fatures and is highly customizable, [WindScribe](https://windscribe.com/?affid=6nh59z1r) also has a ton of features as well as anonymous sign up, yet is very easy to use for all audiences with excellant cross-platform apps. See also:
[Perfect Privacy](https://www.perfect-privacy.com/en/features?a_aid=securitychecklist) -- [TorGuard](https://torguard.net/aff.php?aff=6024) -- [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) -- [PureVPN](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9242873-13842740) -- [NordVPN](https://www.kqzyfj.com/l5115shqnhp4E797DC8467D69A6D) -- [SwitchVPN](https://secure.switchkonnect.com/aff.php?aff=1374) -- [Safer VPN](https://safervpn.com/?a_aid=1413) -- [VirtualShield](https://virtualshield.com/?rfsn=3739717.4cba76) -- [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/cafe/digidef) -- [VPN.ac](https://vpn.ac/aff.php?aff=2178) -- [VyperVPN](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9242873-13805759)

**Full VPN Comparison**: [thatoneprivacysite.net](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/).

#### Word of Warning
- *A VPN does not make you anonymous- it merely chnages your IP accress to that of your VPN provider, instead of ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies/ session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)*
- *Logging- If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider can see (and mess with) all your traffic. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this. See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more*
- *Many reviews are sponsored, and hense biased. Do your own research, or go with one of the above options*
- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is the best option for private browsing

#### Considerations
*While choosing a VPN, consider the following: Logging policy (logs are bad), Jurisdiction (avoid 5-eyes), Number of servers, availability and average load. Payment method (anonymous methods such as BTC, Monero or cash are better), Leak protection (1st-party DNS servers = good, and check if IPv6 is supported), protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard = good). Finally, usability of their apps, user reviews and download speeds.*

#### Self-Hosted VPN
If you don't trust a VPN provider not to keep logs, then you could self-host your own VPN. This gives you you total control, but at the cost of anonymity (since your cloud provider, will require your billing info). See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand), to learn more, and get started with running a VPN.

## Self-Hosted Network Security

Fun little projects that you can run on a Raspberry Pi, or other low-powered computer. In order to help detect and prevent threats, monitor network and filter content

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net)** | Network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole. Pi-Hole can significantly speed up your internet, remove ads and block malware. It comes with a nice web interface and a mobile app with monitoring features, it's open source, easy to install and very widley used
**[IPFire](https://www.ipfire.org)** | A hardened, versatile, state-of-the-art open source firewall based on Linux. Its ease of use, high performance and extensibility make it usable for everyone
**[PiVPN](https://pivpn.io)** | A simple way to set up a home VPN on a any Debian server. Supports OpenVPN and WireGuard with elliptic curve encryption keys up to 512 bit. Supports multiple DNS providers and custom DNS provividers- works nicley along-side PiHole
**[E2guardian](http://e2guardian.org)** | Powerful open source web content filter
**[SquidGuard](http://www.squidguard.org)** | A URL redirector software, which can be used for content control of websites users can access. It is written as a plug-in for Squid and uses blacklists to define sites for which access is redirected

## Mix Networks
[Mix networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_network) are routing protocols, that create hard-to-trace communications, by encrypting and routing traffic through a series of nodes. They help keep you anonymous online, and unlike VPNs -there are no logs

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Tor](https://www.torproject.org)** | Tor provides robust anonymity, allowing you to defend against surveillance, circumvent censorship and reduce tracking. It blocks trackers, resists fingerprinting and implements multi-layered encryption by default, meaning you can browse freely. Tor also allows access to OnionLand: hidden services
**[I2P](https://geti2p.net)** | I2P offers great generic transports, it is well geared towards accessing hidden services, and has a couple of technical benefits over Tor: P2P friendly with unidirectional short-lived tunnels, it is packet-switched (instead of circuit-switched) with TCP and UDP, and continuiosly profiles peers, in order to select the best performing ones. <br>I2P is less mature, but fully-distributed and self-organising, it's smaller size means that it hasn't yet been blocked or DOSed much
**[Freenet]()** | Freenet is easy to setup, provides excelland friend To Friend Sharing vs I2P, and is great for publishing content anonymously. It's quite large in size, and very slow so not the best choice for casual browsing

Tor, I2P and Freenet are all anonimity networks- but they work very differently and each is good for specific purposes. So a good and viable solution would be to use all of them, for different tasks.
*You can read more about how I2P compares to Tor, [here](https://blokt.com/guides/what-is-i2p-vs-tor-browser)*

#### Notable Mentions
[Panoramix](https://panoramix-project.eu) is a European project, aiming to use mix-networks to provide anonymity.
[Nym](https://nymtech.neteu) uses Blockchain, to reward node operators in order to keep the network sustainable.

#### Word of Warning
To provide low-latency browsing, Tor does not not mix packets or generate cover traffic. If an adversary is powerful enough, theoretically they could either observe the entire network, or just the victims entry and exit nodes. It's worth mentioning, that even though your ISP can not see what you are doing, they will be able determine that you are using a mix net, to hide this- a VPN could be used. If you are doing anything which could put you at risk, then good OpSec is essential, as the authoroties have traced criminals through the Tor network before, and [made arrests](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/how-german-and-us-authorities-took-down-the-owners-of-darknet-drug-emporium-wall-street-market).

Note: The Tor netowrk is run by the community. If you benifit from using it, and would like to help sustain uncensored internet access for all- consider [running a Tor relay](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide).

## Proxies
A proxy acts as a gateway between you and the internet, they can be used to act as a firewall or web filter, improves privacy and can also be used to provide shared network connections and cache data to speed up common requests. Never use a [free](https://whatismyipaddress.com/free-proxies) proxy.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[ShadowSocks](https://shadowsocks.org)** | Secure socks5 proxy, designed to protect your Internet traffic. Open source, superfast, cross-platform and easy to deploy, see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shadowsocks)
**[Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org)** | Non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk

#### Notable Mentions
[V2ray-core](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core) is a platform for building proxies to bypass network restrictions and protect your privacy. See [more](https://github.com/hugetiny/awesome-vpn)

#### Word of Warning
[Malicious Proxies](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-edward_zaborowski-doppelganger.pdf) are all too common. Always use open source software, host it yourself or pay for a reputable cloud service. Never use a free proxy; it can monitor your connection, steal cookies and contain malware. VPNs are a better option, better still- use the Tor network.

## DNS
Without using a secure, privacy-centric DNS all your web requests can be seen in the clear. You should configure your DNS queries to be managed by a service that respects privacy and supports DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1)** | One of the most performant options, Cloudflare's DNS supports DoH and DoT, and has a Tor implementation, providing world-class protection. They have native cross-platform apps, for easy set-up.
**[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html)** | Open-source DNS provider, specialising in the blocking of ads, trackers and malicious domains. They have been independently audited and do not keep logs
**[SecureDNS](https://securedns.eu)** | An open source DNS provider, with built-in ad block and additional privacy features. Supports DoH, DoT and DNSCrypt. It is not as performant as some of the bigger players, but still a good option in terms of security
**[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)** | An ad-blocking, privacy-protecting, censorship-bypassing DNS. Also comes with analytics, and the ability to shield kids from adult content

See also this [Full List of Public DoH Servers](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS), you can then check the performance of your chosen server with [DNSPerf](https://www.dnsperf.com/). To read more about choosing secure DNS servers, see [this article](https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-security-and-privacy-choosing-the-right-provider-61fc6d54b986), and [this article](https://geekwire.co.uk/privacy-and-security-focused-dns-resolver/).

#### DNS Protocols
DNS-over-TLS was proposed in [RTC-7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858) by the IETF, then 2 years later, the DNS-over-HTTPS specification was outlined in [RFC8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484) in October '18. [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.info/), is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing, through using cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver, and haven‚Äôt been tampered with. DNSCrypt is a well battle-tested protocol, that has been in use since 2013, and is still widely used.

#### Notable Mentions
- [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net) is a well-funded, performant DNS with a strong focus on privacy and security and easy set-up, however questions have been raised about the motivation of some of the financial backers.
- [BlahDNS](https://blahdns.com) (Japan, Finland or Germany) is an excellant security-focused DNS
- [OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org/), [NixNet DNS](https://nixnet.services/dns) and [UncensoredDNS](https://blog.uncensoreddns.org) are open source and democratic, privacy-focused DNS
- [Clean Browsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/), is a good option for protecting kids,  they offer comprehensive DNS-based Content Filtering

#### Word of Warning
Using an encrypted DNS resolver will not make you anonymous, it just makes it harder for third-partied to discover your domain history. If you are using a VPN, take a [DNS leak test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/), to ensure that some requests are not being exposed.


## Firewalls
A firewall is a program which monitors the incoming and outgoing traffic on your network, and blocks requests based on rules set during its configuration. Properly configured, a firewall can help protect against attempts to remotely access your computer, as well as controll which applictions can access which IPs

**[OpenSense](https://opnsense.org)** <br>(hardware)  | Enterprise firewall and router for protecting networks, built on the FreeBSD system 


#### Word of Warning
There are different [types](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-firewalls) of firewalls, that are used in different circumstances. This does not ommit the need to configure your operating systems defenses. Follow these instructions to enable your firewall in [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off), [Mac OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642), [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) and other [Linux ditros](https://www.tecmint.com/start-stop-disable-enable-firewalld-iptables-firewall).
Even when properly configured, having a firewall enabled does not gaurantee bad network traffic can not get through

## Social Networks

Over the past decade, social networks have revolutionized the way we communicate and bought the world closer together- but it came at the [cost of our privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services). Social networks are built on the principle of sharing- but you, the user should be able to choose with whom you share what, and that is what the following sites  aim to do

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Aether](https://getaether.net)** | Self-governing communities with auditable moderation- a similar concept to Reddit, but more privacy-sensitive, democratic and transparent. Aether is open source and peer-to-peer, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux

- [Pixel Feed](https://pixelfed.org) - photo sharing (similar to Instagram)

#### Main-stream networks
The content on many of these smaller sites tends to be more *niche*. To continue using Twitter, there are a couple of [tweaks](https://www.offensiveprivacy.com/blog/twitter-privacy), that will improve security. For Reddit, use a privacy-respecting client- such as [Reditr](http://reditr.com/). Other main-stream social networking sites do not respect your privacy, so should be avoided, but if you choose to keep using them see [this guide](https://proprivacy.com/guides/social-media-privacy-guide) for tips on protecting your privacy


## Video Platforms

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org)** |  And open source, federated network of inter-connected small videos hosters.

**[BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/)** | A video hosting platform, that was founded in 2017 to allow uploaders to avoid content rules enforced on other platforms, such as YouTube

#### Word of Warning
Without moderation, some of these platforms accommodate video creators, who content may not be appropriate for all audiences

#### YouTube Proxies
The content on many of the smaller video sites, often just doesn't compare to YouTube. So another alternative, is to access YouTube through a proxy client, which reduces what Google can track).
- Good options are: [Invidio](https://invidio.us/) (web), [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) (Android), [YouTube++](https://iosninja.io/ipa-library/download-youtube-plus-ipa-ios) (iOS)

Other minimilistic platforms include [Notepin.co](https://notepin.co) and [Pen.io](http://pen.io)

Want to write a simple text post and promote it yourself? Check out [telegra.ph](https://telegra.ph), [txt.fyi](https://txt.fyi) and [NotePin](https://notepin.co). For seriously anonymous platforms, aimed at activists, see [noblogs](https://noblogs.org/) and [autistici](https://www.autistici.org). It is also possible to host a normal [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) site, without it being linked to your real identity, although WP does not have the best reputation when it comes to privacy.

Of course you could also host your blog on your own server, using a standard open source blog platform, such as [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and configure it to disable all trackers, ads and analytics


## News Readers and Aggregation

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org)** | A free and open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator
**[RSSOwl](http://www.rssowl.org)** | A desktop-based RSS reader, with powerful organisation features
**[Feedly](https://feedly.com)** | A more premium option, Feedly displays news from your selected sources in an easy-to-digest clean and modern interface. It works with more than just RSS feeds, since it is well integrated with many major news outlets. It does not manipulate the stories you see, and is mostly open source

#### Notable Mentions
For iPhone users in the US, [Tonic](https://canopy.cr/tonic) is a great little app that provides you with a selection of personalized new stories and articles daily. It is possible to us [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) anonymously too- you can use throwaway accounts for posting.

#### Word of Warning
News reader apps don't have a good [reputation](https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/apps/privacy-risks-news-apps) when it comes to protecting users privacy, and often display biased content. Many have revenue models based on making recommendations, with the aim of trying to get you to click on sponsored articles- and for that a lot of data needs to have been collected about you, your habits, interests and routines. 


## Payment Methods

Paying for goods and services is a good example of where privacy and security conflict; the most secure option would be to pay with credit card, since most providers include fraud protection, whereas the most private option would be to pay using crypto currency or cash, since neither can be easily tied back to your identity

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org)** | One of the most private cryptocurrencies, since no meta data is available (not even the transaction amount). It uses complex on-chain cryptographic methods such as Ring signatures, RingCT, Kovri, and Stealth addresses all of which help protect the privacy of users
**[ZCash](https://z.cash)** | Uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect privacy cryptographic technique, that allow two users to transact without ever revealing their true identity or address. The Zcash blockchain doesn't record any send or receive addresses


#### Notable Mentions
Cash is still the most private option, with no chance of leaving any transactional  records. See also PIVX, Bitcoin Private and Verge. Also Pirate, Komodo and ZenCash which are hard-forks off of ZCash, with some additional privacy features built-in.


#### Word of Warning
Not all cryptocurrencies are anonymous, and without using a privacy-focused coin, a record of your transaction will live on a publicly available distributed ledger, forever. If you send of receive multiple payments, ensure you switch up addresses or use a mixer, to make it harder for anyone trying to trace your transactions. Store private keys somewhere safe, but offline and preferably cold.


## Anti-Virus and Malware Prevention

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[CalmAV](https://www.clamav.net)** | An open source  cross-platform antivirus engine for detecting viruses, malware & other malicious threats. It is versatile, performant and very effective
**[Windows Spy Blocker](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker)** | Capture and interprets network traffic based on a set of rules, and depending on the interactions certain assignments are blocked. Open source, written in Go and delivered as a single executable
**[Cylance](https://www.cylance.com)** | Takes more of an application whitelisting approach, where it generates the list of trusted software through machine learning. So instead of identifying bad software to block, it identifies good software instead, and blocks the rest by default
**[Malware Bytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com)** | If you think your computer may be infected, or have malicious files, then Malware Bytes is a good option for running 1-off scans. It is thorough in identifying threats, with minimum data collection

#### Notable Mentions
Your operating system's built-in protection is probably adequate for detecting 99% of threats. Installing additional software can introduce more vulnerabilities, so downloading AV may actually increase your attack surface.

Windows, by default is not very private. There are several packages that can be used to quickly tweak privacy settings. Such as [Simple Wall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall), [priv10](https://github.com/DavidXanatos/priv10), [Fix-Windows-Privacy](https://modzero.github.io/fix-windows-privacy/) and [W10 Privacy](https://www.w10privacy.de/english-home) (see [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qttbd2Ouxmc)). Use at your own risk, disabling sore OS features can cause unintended consequences. See also, this [Windows 10 Privacy Guide](https://github.com/adolfintel/Windows10-Privacy) for manual steps


#### Word of Warning
Many anti virus products have a history of introducing bad vulnerabilities themselves, and several of them seriously degrade the performance of your computer, as well as decrease your security. Never use a free anti-virus, and never trust the companies that offer free solutions, even if you pay for the premium package. Providers such as Avast, AVG, McAfee and Kasperky - do not use these AV solutions. Read more about why you shouldn't use [Anti-Spy Tools, on Windows](https://as93.link/gjlj4)


## Mobile Operating Systems

If you are an Android user, your device has Google built-in at it's core. [Google tracks you](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/),
collecting a wealth of information, and logging your every move. A [custom ROM](https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-custom-rom-android/), is an open source, usually Google-free mobile OS that can be [flashed](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-custom-rom-android/) to your device.


| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/)** | A free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform- Lineage is light-weight, well maintained, supports a wide range of devices, and comes bundled with [Privacy Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Privacy_Guard)
**[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)** | GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility. Developed by the team behind [CoperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/). Graphene is a young project, and currently only supports Pixel devices, partially due to their strong hardware security

#### Other Notable Mentions
[Replicant OS](https://www.replicant.us/) is a fully-featured distro, with an emphasis on freedom, privacy and security. [MmniRom](https://www.omnirom.org/), [Recursion Remix](https://forum.xda-developers.com/remix), and [Paranoid Android](http://paranoidandroid.co/) are also popular options. Alternativley, [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com/) is a Linux (Ubuntu)- based OS. It is secure by design and runs on almost any device, - but it does fall short when it comes to the app store.

To install apps, without Play Store- see [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/). For Google Play Service see [MicroG](https://microg.org/)


#### Word of Warning
It is not recommended to root, or flash your device with a custom ROM if you are not an advanced user. There are risks involved
- Although the above ROMs omit Google, they do open up other security issues: Without DM-verity on the system partition, the file system *could* be tampered with, and no verified boot stack, the kernel/initramfs also *could* be edited. You should understand the risks, before proceeding to flash a custom ROM to your device
- You will need to rely on updates from the community, which could be slower to be released- this may be an issue for a time-urgent, security-critical patch
- It is also possible to brick your device, through interrupted install or bad software
- Finally, rooting and flashing your device, will void your warranty


## PC Operating Systems

Windows 10 has many features, that violate your privacy. Microsoft and Apple are able to collect all your data (including, but not limited to: keystrokes, searches and mic input, calendar data, music, photos, credit card information and purchases. Identity, passwords, contacts, conversations and location data). Microsoft Windows is also more suseptible to malware and viruses, than alternative systems.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)** (containerized apps) | Open-source security-oriented operating system for single-user desktop computing. It uses virtualisation, to run each application in it's own compartment to avoid data being leaked. It features [Split GPG](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg/), [U2F Proxy](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/u2f-proxy/), and [Whonix integration](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/whonix/). Qubes makes is easy to create [disposable VMs](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/disposablevm/) which are spawned quickly and destroyed when closed. Qubes is [recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/781493632293605376) by Edward Snowden
**[Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/)** (VM) | Whonix is an anonymous operating system, which can run in a VM, inside your current OS. It is the best way to use Tor, and provides very strong protection for your IP address. It comes bundled with other features too: Keystroke Anonymization, Time Attack Defences, Stream Isolation, Kernel Self Protection Settings and an Advanced Firewall. Open source, well audited, and with a strong community- Whonix is based on Debian, [KickSecure](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure) and [Tor](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_and_Tor)
**[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)** (live) | Tails is a live operating system (so you boot into it from a USB, instead of installing). It preserves your privacy and anonymity through having no persistent memory/ leaving no trace on the computer. Tails has Tor built-in system-wide, and uses state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging. Open source, and built on top of Debian
**[Parrot](https://parrotlinux.org/)** (security)| Parrot Linux, is a full Debian-based operating system, that is geared towards security, privacy and development. It is fully-featured yet light-weight, very open. There are 3 edditions: General Purpose, Security and Forensic. The Secure distribution includes its own sandbox system obtained with the combination of [Firejail](https://firejail.wordpress.com/) and [AppArmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor) with custom security profiles. While the Forensics Edition is bundled with a comprehensive suit of security/ pen-testing tools, similar to Kali and Black Arch
**[Discreete Linux](https://www.privacy-cd.org/)** (offline)| Aimed at journalists, activists and whistle-blowers, Discreete Linux is similar to Tails, in that it is booted live from external media, and leaves no/ minimal trace on the system. The aim of the project, was to provide all required cryptographic tools offline, to protect against Trojan-based surveillance


#### General Purpose Linux Distros
If you do not want to use a specalist security-based distro, or you are new to Unix- then just switching to any well-maintained Linux distro, is going to be significantly more secure and private than Windows or Mac OS. Since it is open source, majour distros are constantly being audited by members of the community. Also Linux does not give users admin rights by default- this makes is much less likley that your system could become infected with malware.  There is no proprietary Microsoft or Apple software constantly monitoring everything you do, and building up a data profile on you. Some good distros to consider would be: **[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)**, **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)**, or **[Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)**- all of which have a large community behind them. **[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)** (based of Arch), is also a good option, with a simple install process. Used by new comers, and expers alike. See [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions).

#### Improve the Security and Privacy of your current OS
If you want to stick with your current OS, then see this [Windows 10 guide](https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/windows-10-security-guide/privacy), by Heimdal Security- it will guide you through the settings that you should update, to minimise the amount that Microsoft and other third-parties track you. For Apple users, this [Mac OS guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/mac-privacy-tips/), will walk you through the equivalent steps. For Linux, you are far more secure by default, but there are a few steps to take, as seen in this [Linux guide](https://spreadprivacy.com/linux-privacy-tips/).


## Windows Defences

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[HardenTools]** | A utility that disables a number of risky Windows features. These "features" are exposed by the OS and primary consumer applications, and very commonly abused by attackers, to execute malicious code on a victim's computer. So this tool just reduces the attack surface by disabling the low-hanging fruit
**[Sticky-Keys-Slayer]** | Scans for accessibility tools backdoors via RDP
**[SigCheck]** | Audit a Windows host's root certificate store against Microsoft's Certificate Trust List (CTL)
**[Windows Secure Baseline]** | Group Policy objects, compliance checks, and configuration tools that provide an automated and flexible approach for securely deploying and maintaining the latest releases of Windows 10

## Home Automation

If you have smart devices within your home, you should consider running the automation locally, rather than using a cloud service. This will reduce the amount of exploits you could potentially be vulnrable to. It is also important to have network monitoring and firewalls enabled, to ensure suspicious activity is flagged or blocked. The following projects will make controlling and monitoring IoT devices within your home easier, safer and more private

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** | Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first- 1500+ integrations. Runs well on a Raspberry Pi, accessible though a web interface and CLI, as well as several controller apps (such as [HassKit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thhkstudio.hasskit) and the official [Home Assistant App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android))
**[OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org)** | A vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home, with 2000+ supported devices and addons. Works well on a Raspberry Pi, or low-powerd home server, and again there are some great apps for, such as the official [OpenHabb App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid) and the [HomeHabit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.homehabit.view) wall dashboard
**[Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com)** | Another home automation system, Domoticz is more geared towards connecting and monitoring sensors within your space. Allows you to monitor your environment without anyone but you having access to the data
**[Node-RED](https://nodered.org)** | Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services, it provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to build flows with a wide range of supported nodes, and it is easy to deploy locally in your network

#### Notable Mentions 
For creating dashboard from IoT devices, see [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io). Another home automation tool is [FHEM](https://fhem.de/fhem.html), which has been around for a while and needs a bit more work to get up and running, but is still a popular option

#### Word of Warning
IoT smart home devices can open you up to many security risks and exploits. It is really important that you configure them correctly, setting strong unique passwords, turn off data sharing, and if possible restrict internet access so devices can only communicate within your local network. See [Smart Home Security Checklist](https://github.com/ParthXD7/personal-security-checklist#smart-home) for more tips


## AI Voice Assistants

Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri don't have the best [reputation](https://srlabs.de/bites/smart-spies) when it comses to protecting consumers privacy, there have been [many recent breached](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924886/alexa-google-home-security-vulnerability-srlabs-phishing-eavesdropping). For that reason it is recommended not to have these devices in your house. The following are open source AI voice assistants, that aim to provide a human voice interface while also protecting your privacy and security

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai)** | An open source privacy-respecting AI platform, that runs on many platforms (Raspberry Pi, desktop, or dedicated Mycroft device). It is in active development, with thorough documentation and a broad range of available skills, but also Mycroft makes it really easy to develop new skills
**[Kalliope](https://kalliope-project.github.io)** | An open source, modular always-on voice controlled personal assistant designed for home automation. It runs well on Raspberry Pi, Debian or Ubuntu and is easy to program with simple YAML-based skills, but does not have a wide library of pre-built add-ons

#### Notable Mentions
For a desktop-based assistant, see [Dragonfire](https://github.com/DragonComputer/Dragonfire) for Ubunto, and [Jarvis](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis) for MacOS.  [LinTO](https://linto.ai), [Jovo](https://www.jovo.tech) and [Snips](https://snips.ai) are private-by-design voice assistant frameworks that can be built on by developers, or used by enterprises. [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io), [Stephanie](https://github.com/SlapBot/stephanie-va) and [Hey Athena](https://github.com/rcbyron/hey-athena-client) are Python-based voice assistant, but neither is under active development anymore. See also [OpenAssistant](https://openassistant.org).

#### Word of Warning
If you are building your own assistant, you may want to consider a hardware-switch for disabling the microphone. Keep tabs on issues and check the code, to ensure you are happy with how it works, from a privacy perspective


## Bonus: Alternatives to Google

Moving away from Google, and using multiple alternative apps will mean there is no single source of tracking. Open source and privacy-focused software is best

## Additional Self-Hosted Tools

Hosting an open source application on your own server or using a secure cloud provider, immediately means that you own all data and logs. Hence no one other than you can easily get to this. However it is worth noting that you will ensure the server is properly secure, and keep all software up-to-date yourself

#### Analytics Platforms
[Matomo](https://matomo.org) - Enterprise-grade analytics platform, that is 100% open source and has a strong foucs on ethics when it comes to privacy. See also: [Ackee](https://ackee.electerious.com), [Freshlytics](https://freshlytics.gitbook.io) and [Goat Counter](https://www.goatcounter.com).


---

## Conclusion
Many coporations that put profit before people, collecting data and exploiting privacy, many claim to to secure but without being open source it can't be verified, and it is always too late once there has been a breach. Switching to privacy-respecting, open souece software will drastically help inmprove your security, privacy and anonimity online.

However, that's not all you need to do- it is important to also: Use strong and unique passwords, 2-factor authentication,
adopt good networking practices and be mindful of data that is collected when browsing the web. You can see the full
